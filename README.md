The application which I proposed is a marketplace built on Android Studio, 
allowing users to e-commerce. This app addresses the need for a platform where
individuals can easily find goods at affordable prices and contribute to a more 
eco-friendly lifestyle. Users can buy their items at sale(pre-owned), including 
details like product description, images, and pricing. Additionally, a search and 
filter functionality will enable users to quickly find specific items or browse 
through various categories. Features like selecting items on the basis of quality 
and price will also be there. One can also categorise items on the basis of it's 
function such as toys, food items, thrifted clothings, accomodation and so on.
